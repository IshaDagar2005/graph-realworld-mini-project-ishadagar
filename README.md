#Graph Algorithms in Real-Life Applications
Design and Analysis of Algorithms – Lab Assignment 3

#Overview

This project implements four major graph algorithms and applies them to realistic scenarios such as social networks, navigation systems, emergency routing, and network infrastructure design.

Algorithms Implemented
1. Friend Suggestion System

Algorithm: BFS/DFS-based Mutual Friend Counting
Application: Social networks (Facebook, LinkedIn)
Purpose: Suggest new connections based on mutual friends.

2. Google Maps Route Finder

Algorithm: Bellman–Ford
Application: Navigation systems
Purpose: Shortest paths even with negative weights.

3. Emergency Response Routing

Algorithm: Dijkstra’s Algorithm
Application: Disaster management
Purpose: Fastest route in positive-weight city maps.

4. Network Cable Optimization

Algorithm: Prim’s MST
Application: Telecom / IT infrastructure
Purpose: Connect all buildings at minimum cost.
